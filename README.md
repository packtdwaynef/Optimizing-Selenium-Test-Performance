# Optimizing Selenium Test Performance

This is the code repository for [Optimizing Selenium Test Performance [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/web-development/optimizing-selenium-test-performance-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.


## About the Video Course

Selenium 3.0 is a significant change as it has been shipped after a gap of 5 years. It is only a drop-in replacement for WebDriver API users; however, it has removed the major Selenium core implementation. The Selenium WebDriver API is fully object-oriented as opposed to the deprecated Selenium RC. The WebDriver API provides multi-language support and runs tests on all popular browsers. As your knowledge (and the size of your test suites) grows, performance becomes a key factor for development teams to successfully adopt your automation . 
In this course, we'll focus on the most common performance bottlenecks and how to work round them through optimization and parallelization. We'll finish the course with the use of Selenium Grid and Sauce Labs for limitless parallelization and other goodies.
